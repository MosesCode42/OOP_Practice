## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Practice
Welcome to my OOP practice repository! This is a collection of Python code examples and exercises that focus on object-oriented programming principles.
If you're looking to improve your understanding of OOP concepts or want to sharpen your skills in writing clean, 
reusable, and organized code, check it out. NB: This is my practice so if you spot a few errors, feel free to comment... Thank you
